# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# This workflow will build a Java project with Gradle and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time

      # If your project does not have the Gradle Wrapper configured, you can use the following configuration to run Gradle with a specified version.
